## IdentityBot
Searches for reddit comments in the specified subreddit in the following form:
"!identify /u/SomeUserName"

The bot will then comment with a table of the AMA-style posts that a user has made in the past.
See [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/botwatch/comments/3mit7l/i_wrote_a_bot_that_looks_for_a_users_ama_posts/) for an example.
